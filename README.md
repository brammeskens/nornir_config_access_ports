# Nornir config access ports
## Dependencies

    pip3 install nornir
    pip3 install nornir_utils
    pip3 install nornir_jinja2
    pip3 install nornir_netmiko

    pip3 install rich
    pip3 install getpass
    pip3 install ntc-templates

## Overview
This script is built around Nornir3 and its various plugins. For ease of use and readability, getpass and rich were also incorporated.


## How to Use
**Note:** General usage of Nornir is required. Please see [nornir.tech](https://nornir.tech) or [nornir-automation](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir/)
**Note 2:** Using the [ntc-templates](https://github.com/networktocode/ntc-templates) through PyPI never worked out for me. To ease the set-up I have copied the ntc_templates folder directly in the same destination folder. You may have better luck than me by using the PyPI-version.
